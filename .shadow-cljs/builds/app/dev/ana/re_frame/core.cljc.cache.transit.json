And, at that time, re-frame\r\n *   needs to know how to create the node.   By calling `reg-sub`, you are registering\r\n *   'the template' or 'the mechanism' by which nodes in the Signal Graph can be created.\r\n * \r\n *   Repeating: calling `reg-sub` does not create a node. It only creates the template\r\n *   from which nodes can be created later.\r\n * \r\n *   `reg-sub` arguments are:\r\n *  - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\r\n *  - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\r\n *  - a function which computes the value of this kind of node\r\n * \r\n *   The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and it is expected to have the signature:\r\n *  `(input-values, query-vector) -> a-value`\r\n * \r\n *   When `computation function` is called, the `query-vector` argument will be the vector supplied to the\r\n *   the `subscribe` which caused the node to be created. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 \"blue\"])`,\r\n *   then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 \"blue\"]`.\r\n * \r\n *   The arguments supplied between the `query-id` and the `computation-function` can vary in 3 ways,\r\n *   but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part of the template, controlling what input\r\n *  values \"flow into\" the `computation function` gets when it is called.\r\n * \r\n *   `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways to define the input signals part.\r\n *   But note, the 2nd method, in which a `signal-fn` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and instructive. The other\r\n *   two are really just sugary variations.\r\n * \r\n *   1. No input signals given:\r\n *    ```clj\r\n *   (reg-sub\r\n *     :query-id\r\n *     a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\r\n *   ```\r\n * \r\n *   In the absence of an explicit `input-fn`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\r\n *   and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\r\n *   is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n *   2. A signal function is explicitly supplied:\r\n *   ```clj\r\n *   (reg-sub\r\n *     :query-id\r\n *     signal-fn     ;; <-- here\r\n *     computation-fn)\r\n *   ```\r\n * \r\n *   This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\r\n * \r\n *   When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\r\n *   is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\r\n *   one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\r\n * \r\n *   The values from returned nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\r\n *   the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\r\n *   this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\r\n *   the structure returned by the `signal-fn`).\r\n * \r\n *   This example `signal-fn` returns a vector of input signals.\r\n *     ```clj\r\n *     (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\r\n *       [(subscribe [:a-sub])\r\n *        (subscribe [:b-sub])])\r\n *     ```\r\n *   The associated computation function must be written\r\n *   to expect a vector of values for its first argument:\r\n *     ```clj\r\n *     (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\r\n *       ....)\r\n *      ```\r\n * \r\n *   If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\r\n *      ```clj\r\n *      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\r\n *        (subscribe [:a-sub]))\r\n *      ```\r\n *   then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\r\n *   as the 1st argument:\r\n *      ```clj\r\n *      (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\r\n *        ...)\r\n *      ```\r\n * \r\n *   Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\r\n *     ```clj\r\n *   (reg-sub\r\n *     :query-id\r\n *     a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\r\n *   ```\r\n *   is the equivalent of using this\r\n *   2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\r\n *   ```clj\r\n *   (reg-sub\r\n *     :query-id\r\n *     (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit input-fn\r\n *     a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\r\n *   ```\r\n * \r\n *   3. Syntax Sugar\r\n * \r\n *   ```clj\r\n *   (reg-sub\r\n *     :a-b-sub\r\n *     :<- [:a-sub]\r\n *     :<- [:b-sub]\r\n *     (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\r\n *       {:a a :b b}))\r\n *   ```\r\n * \r\n *   This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.

And, at that time, re-frame\n  needs to know how to create the node.   By calling `reg-sub`, you are registering\n  'the template' or 'the mechanism' by which nodes in the Signal Graph can be created.\n\n  Repeating: calling `reg-sub` does not create a node. It only creates the template\n  from which nodes can be created later.\n\n  `reg-sub` arguments are:\n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways)\n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node\n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and it is expected to have the signature:\n    `(input-values, query-vector) -> a-value`\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the `query-vector` argument will be the vector supplied to the\n  the `subscribe` which caused the node to be created. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 \\\"blue\\\"])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 \\\"blue\\\"]`.\n\n  The arguments supplied between the `query-id` and the `computation-function` can vary in 3 ways,\n  but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part of the template, controlling what input\n values \\\"flow into\\\" the `computation function` gets when it is called.\n\n  `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways to define the input signals part.\n  But note, the 2nd method, in which a `signal-fn` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and instructive. The other\n  two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  1. No input signals given:\n      ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `input-fn`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  2. A signal function is explicitly supplied:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n       computation-fn)\n     ```\n\n     This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\n     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n     one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n     The values from returned nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n     the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n     this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n     the structure returned by the `signal-fn`).\n\n     This example `signal-fn` returns a vector of input signals.\n       ```clj\n       (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n       ```\n     The associated computation function must be written\n     to expect a vector of values for its first argument:\n       ```clj\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         ....)\n        ```\n\n     If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n          (subscribe [:a-sub]))\n        ```\n     then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n     as the 1st argument:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n          ...)\n        ```\n\n     Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n       ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n     is the equivalent of using this\n     2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit input-fn\n       a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n\n  3. Syntax Sugar\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-b-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       :<- [:b-sub]\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         {:a a :b b}))\n     ```\n\n     This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n     `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n     If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n     as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n         ...))\n     ```\n\n  For further understanding, read `/docs`, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs\n  \"\n  [query-id & args]\n  (apply subs/reg-sub (into [query-id] args)))\n\n(defn subscribe\n  \"Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which, over\n  time, reactively delivers a stream of values.

The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change.

Eg: that edit\n  just made might have introduced a new duplicate, or removed one. Same with\n  any todo removal. So we need to re-calculate warnings after any CRUD events\n  associated with the todos list.\n\n  Unless we are careful, we might end up coding subtly different checks\n  for each kind of CRUD operation.  The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change. It will inspect all the todos, and\n  reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\n  and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\n\n  https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\n\n  By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\n  we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\n  (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\n\n  We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\n  any CRUD operation.\n\n  This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\n  each time.
